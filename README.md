## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

This project is a ReactJS implementation of the Game of Life, allowing users to create and manipulate the game board, start and stop the simulation, and observe the patterns that emerge.

## Features

- Create custom initial configurations.
- Control the simulation with start, stop, and reset buttons.
- Adjust the speed of the simulation.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop usage.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have npm and Node.js installed. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Harry-Leslie/Conways-Game-of-Life.git
cd Conways-Game-of-Life

### Install Dependancies 

npm install

### Start Application

npm start

The application will start on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
Clone the repository and follow the installation steps.
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Use the grid to create an initial configuration by clicking on cells to toggle them between alive and dead states.
Use the control buttons to start, stop, and reset the simulation.
Adjust the speed of the simulation using the speed control slider.
